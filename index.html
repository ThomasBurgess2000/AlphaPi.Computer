            <h2>The distraction-free writing tool that doesn't break your budget like the Freewrite.</h2>
            <h3>Here's how it stacks up against the Freewrite:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Customizable - have a keyboard you already love? Type away. Have extra USB battery packs? Power on.</li>
                <li>Portable - weighs less than a pound (compared to four pounds) </li>
                <li>Hackable - the software is open-source and ready for modding.</li>
                <li>Budgetable - you can build the AlphaPi yourself for less than 25% of the cost of a Freewrite. </li>
            <!--<p>At its core is the experience you expect from your Alphasmart: distraction-free writing. But it also includes other features made possible by the advances in technology since the last Alphasmart came out in 2007, such as wireless sync of your files, tons of font choices, hotswappable components, and more.</p>-->
