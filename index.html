            <p>This is the home site for the AlphaPi, the spiritual successor of the late Alphasmart that doesn't break your budget like the Freewrite.</p>
            <p>At its core is the experience you expect from your Alphasmart: distraction-free writing. But it also includes other features made possible by the advances in technology since the last Alphasmart came out in 2007, such as wireless sync of your files, tons of font choices, hotswappable components, and more.</p>
